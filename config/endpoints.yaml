# API Endpoints Configuration
# Define all Invezgo API endpoints to fetch data from
#
# Execution Modes:
#   - onetime: Run once to fetch reference/lookup data (e.g., lists)
#   - batch: Run periodically with different parameters (e.g., daily summaries)
#   - streaming: Real-time or near-real-time data ingestion

endpoints:
  # === ONETIME ENDPOINTS ===
  # These endpoints fetch reference data that changes infrequently
  
  # Stock list
  - name: stock_list
    path: /analysis/list/stock
    description: "List of all available stocks"
    bq_table: stock_list

  # === BATCH ENDPOINTS ===
  # These endpoints run periodically with different parameters
  
  # Broker summary per stock (batch processing)

      # Date iteration for daily processing
      # IMPORTANT: Date ranges are split into individual days
      # Example: --start-date 2025-10-20 --end-date 2025-10-24
      #   = 5 separate API calls (one per day)
      #   NOT: from=2025-10-20&to=2025-10-24 (would give averaged data)

      #        from=2025-10-21&to=2025-10-21 (daily data)
